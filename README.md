# About me

**My name is Alex Nord. I'm 34 years old an live on the west coast of Sweden. I've worked as a programmer and web developer since 2005.**

I started with HTML, CSS, PHP and SQL. Before WordPress was popular, I was writing my own content managing systems. I decided to specialise in WordPress development after realizing every client and company I worked for was using it.

JavaScript is my favorite programming language for both backend and frontend development. React is my favorite frontend framework. One of my favorite things to do in web development is writing APIs.

Because code needs somewhere to run, I am also very interested in network infrastructure, load balancing and scaling. I'm a huge advocate for containerization, serverless functions and Kubernetes.
